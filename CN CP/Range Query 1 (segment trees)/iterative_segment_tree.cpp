// if the original array size = n, then in segment tree, all these n values would be stored in leaf nodes
// therefore number of nodes in binary tree having n leaf nodes = 2n-1
/*
The size of a segment tree array exceeding 
2n is related to the representation of the tree structure in the array. While the total number of nodes in a segment tree is 
2nâˆ’1, the size of the array needed to represent the tree may need to be larger than 
2n to provide a convenient and efficient implementation.
Also, always remember that the numbering inside the segment tree array is 1-based
that is i=1 is root node and then the other nodes
Now this 1 based indexing means that the segment tree's node's values are present at these indexes in the segment tree array,
so it doesnt mean that we cannot store 0 or -ve values in iterative segment tree (because of 1-based indexing)
i = 1-based indexing represents only the node index in segment tree, but the value inside that st[i] can be anything
