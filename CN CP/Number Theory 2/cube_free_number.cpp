Find The Cube Free Number

A cube free number is a number whoâ€™s none of the divisor is a cube number (A cube number is a cube of a integer like 8 (2 * 2 * 2) , 
27 (3 * 3 * 3) ). So cube free numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 etc (we will consider 1 as cube free). 
8, 16, 24, 27, 32 etc are not cube free number. So the position of 1 among the cube free numbers is 1, position of 2 is 2, 3 is 3 and 
position of 10 is 9. Given a positive number you have to say if its a cube free number and if yes then tell its position 
among cube free numbers.

Note: we will consider 1 as the 1st cube free number

Input Format:
First line of the test case will be the number of test case T 
Each test case contain an integer N
Output Format:
For each test case print the position of N in cube free numbers and if its not a cube free number print "Not Cube Free" in a newline.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10^5
1 <= N <= 10^6

Sample Input:
10
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10

Sample Output:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
Not Cube Free
8
9

// approach : we would pre compute all cube free numbers before only, before taking in test cases
// for that, we would use sieve algo : basically when we find any prime number, then we would start marking its multiples as non-prime
// but if that multiple is divible by this prime-number's cube , then we would mark this cubic multiple differently
